# Create a folder called ruby-colearning-warmup.
# Inside this folder create the file warmup-001.rb

# Your task is to create a program that prints to the console the
# three top favorite things to do in Berlin from three different
# people in this group.

# Example: Your program should prompt to the user something like this
# "Who do you want to know more about: Gustavo, Duilio or Max?"

# If the user chooses "Gustavo" the program should print to the
# console "Gustavo's favorite things to do in Berlin are go dancing,
# attending the ruby co-learning meetup, and drinking beer"

# After you are done coding, push your code to Github.
