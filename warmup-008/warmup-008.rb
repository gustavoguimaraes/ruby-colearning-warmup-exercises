# Name: Words Highlighter
# Instructions:
# Some long, very long texts have many words. Many of them are repeated
# so much time that our team is unable to count them.
# Could you read the text for us and send us the same text with the words upcased?
# Only if the words repeats more than twice..
# and maybe can we choose the amount of more importants one? Maybe only the first 10 more repeated

#example:
# "Bu ba mu er ro mo ba fu me go ba mo ge mo"

# "Bu BA mu er ro MO BA fu me go BA MO ge MO"
