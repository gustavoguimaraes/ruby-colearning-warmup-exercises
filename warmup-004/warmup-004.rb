# Go to your ruby colearning warmup exercises folder
# Once there create a folder and name it warmup-004
# Inside this folder create two files: one titled warmup-004.rb and the other
# warmup-004_spec.rb

# To get yourself into the test-first habit, first copy the tests in
# https://github.com/gustavoguimaraes/ruby-colearning-warmup-exercises/blob/master/warmup-004/warmup-004_spec.rb
# and add to your warm-004_spec.rb. Write an additional test to it.
# You can use the test that is already written as a reference.

# Your task is to create a count_words method in warm-004.rb that count the number of words in a given
# sentence. Say you have the sentence "I love Ruby", your count_words method should return 3.

#Push your code to github.
